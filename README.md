# 🧠 ML Mini Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of machine learning mini projects! This collection showcases small, focused, and self-contained experiments across various ML topics. Each project lives in its own folder under `/projects/` and includes code, notebooks, and results, offering a hands-on look at different models and techniques.

## 📁 Project Structure

Here's how this repository is organized:

```bash
ml-mini-projects/
├── LICENSE         # MIT License
├── .gitignore      # Ignores common Python artifacts and environment files
├── README.md       # (You are here!) This overview of the portfolio
└── projects/       # All ML mini-projects reside in this directory
├── 01-example-project/
├── 02-another-one/
└── ...
```

Each individual project folder is designed to be self-contained and typically includes:

* **📓 Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts:** The core code for the project.
* **📊 Sample datasets or generated data:** Data used for the project's analysis or model training.
* **🧪 `requirements.txt`:** For isolated dependencies, ensuring reproducibility.
* **📝 A local `README.md`:** A dedicated explanation of that specific project.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Ready to dive into a project? Here's how you can run any of the mini-projects locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/zakir-codes/ml-mini-projects.git](https://github.com/zakir-codes/ml-mini-projects.git)
    cd ml-mini-projects
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a specific project:**
    ```bash
    cd projects/01-example-project # Replace '01-example-project' with the project you want to explore
    ```
3.  **Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use: .\venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    This will open the Jupyter interface in your browser, where you can explore and run the project's notebooks.
